
Description:
This working data file set, prepared by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Occupational Medicine Group, consists of four working files prepared for epidemiologic studies of workers at the Mound Plant in Ohio during 1941-1979.
The MDFACW02 data file set consists of four working files that were generated by the Epidemiology Section at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for mortality studies of workers employed at Mound. Data were obtained in various formats and media from Mound departments and other agencies. Demographic data were abstracted from employment record cards and employee information sheets provided by the Personnel Department at Mound. Supplemental data were obtained from the Social Security Administration (SSA) 941A forms, Mound medical records, and Mound health physics records. Death information was abstracted from death certificates obtained from various states. External ionizing radiation exposure and polonium bioassay data, in hard copy, were provided by the Health Physics Department at Mound.
The four files in the MDFACW02 data file set are segregated by type of data: demographic, work history, external exposure and polonium bioassay results. Data pertaining to an individual that appear in one or more files may be linked by the individual identification number assigned to each worker.
The first working file MDFACW02_d1 (MDPERSON) contains demographic information, including race, sex and birth date, limited work history information, and death information, such as cause-of-death, date of death, and state of death, for 6,881 male and female workers hired between 1941 and 1979, inclusive. The file includes 1,692 females, 5,182 males and 7 with unknown sex. Race was determined for 88% of the workers. Death information was last obtained in 1992 using a submission to the National Death Index (NDI). The NDI searched records available from 1979 through 1990. There are 1,730 deaths identified in this working file. Cause of death information (ICDA8) is not available for three deaths. The last effort to obtain confirmed vital status information for the entire cohort was also conducted in 1992 with a submission to the TRAX service followed by mail and phone tracing. Vital status was confirmed for 90% of the cohort through January 1, 1989.
The second working file MDFACW02_d2 (MNDOCCUP) contains occupational histories from 1941 through 1981 for 6,771 employees. There are 20,977 records in the file. The file includes dates started on the job, the verbatim job title used by Mound, and an alphanumeric job code used by Mound, which was associated with each job title. For approximately one- third of the cohort, some single employment intervals were mistakenly coded as two distinct periods of employment. This information has never been used in any studies and should be revised before use.
The third working file MDFACW02_d3 (MNDEXTER) contains the external ionizing radiation exposure data. There are 32,351 records for 4,081 identified individuals and 438 records for individuals not assigned an identification number. The years covered by this file are 1947 through 1979. The variables include annual neutron, tritium, and whole body dose (in millirems) incurred while working at the Mound Plant and the neutron, tritium and whole body doses received prior to employment at Mound.
The fourth working file MDFACW02_d4 (MNDPOLON) contains results of polonium urine bioassays between March 30, 1944 and June 5, 1984. There are 201,652 records for 2,788 individuals. The data include the date of the sample, polonium activity in the sample, volume of urine in the sample, and any comments about the particular sample or its results.
